Action tags:- used to control the flow between the pages and to use javabean.
jsp: forward:- the request and responce to another resource
jsp: include:- another resource
jsp: userbean:- crates bean object
jsp: setProperty:- set the value of property in bean object
jsp: getProperty:- print the value of the property of the bean
jsp: param:- sets the parameter value
jsp: plugin:- embeds the another components
jsp: fallback:- if our plugin is working, can used to check (print message)(jsp: plugin)

java bean :- 
	java bean is a java class it follows the mentioned rules.
	it should provide to set and get the value of the properties.
	it should have a no arg constructor
	it should be serializable

Why javabean?
Encapsulated many object into a single object.

getPropertyName(), setPropertyName()
	
JSP:useBean

<jsp:useBean id="" scope="" class="" type="" beanname=""></jsp:userBean>
id -> identify the bean in the scope
Scope -> page, request, session, application default scope=page
page -> specify that you can use this bean with the jsp page.
Request -> you can use his from any jsp page that processes the same request.
(Request has the wide scope than page)
session -> you can use this bean from any jsp page in the same session.	
application -> you can use this bean from 
class -> bean class (Create an object of the bean), it must have no-arg constructor.it not be abstract.
Type -> maily used class or beanname attribute(provide the bean type).
beanname -> instanstiates the bean using instantiate() method.	

JSTL 

represent a set of tags to make development in JSP
Advantage:
Faster development, code reusability, we can avoid scriplet tag

5 types of tags:-
core tags -> variable support, flow control prefix(c)
function tags -> string maniplution prefix:(fn)
formatting tags -> date, number and other formatting prefix:fmt
XML tags -> flow control, transformation prefix:x
SQl tags -> sql support prefix:sql

core tags
c:out -> display the result
c:set -> set the result of an expression
c:remove -> remove the specified scoped variable from a particular scope.
c:if -> testing the condition and display the content only
c:url, c:redirect, c:param, c:foreach, c:import etc.
