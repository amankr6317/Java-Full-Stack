Queue	----

Queue is interface in java.util. extends collection interface.
FIFO(First in First out).
Insert elements, delete elemnets, iterator.
Queue<Integer> q=new LinkedList();
q.add()
Remove first element.
q.peek();
q.size();
Operations : Adding elements, Removing elements,iterating the queue(iterator)

Priority Queue	----

it should be processed according to the priority.
Queue<Integer> q=new PriorityQueue<Integer>();
q.peek();
q.poll();

Map Interface	----

Map contains values on the basis of key and value pair.
Key-value pair is known as Entry.
A map doesn,t allow duplicate keys but you can have duplicate values.
Hashmap and LinkedHashMap allow null keys and values but TreeMap doesn't allow any null key value.
Hashmap doesn't maintain any order.

Hash Table		----
Java Hashtable class contains unique elements.

Multitasking, Multiprocessing, MultiThreading	----

Multitasking - Performing multiple task at single time.
Multiprocessing - When a system is connected to multiple processors in order to complete task.
Multithreading - Executing multiple threads at single time.

Process VS Thread	----

Process - 
a program which is in execution(Heavy Weight).
will take more time. 
each process has different address space.
process are not dependent on each other.
process does not require synchronization. 
process require more resources.

thread - 
it is a subpart of process.
thread will take less time.
threads share same address space.
thread dependent on each other.
thread may required synchronization.
thread require less resource.
